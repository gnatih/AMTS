You will find here .gpx format files for all AMTS Bus Routes. I am collating most 
of the data available online, and tracking new routes as well. The reason to make 
these files as .gpx is to also make them usable as OpenStreetMap traces. 

These files are an output of the OpenGPSTracker software, available for Android 
phones here - http://code.google.com/p/open-gpstracker

Feel free to add to the routes list, or suggest corrections.
